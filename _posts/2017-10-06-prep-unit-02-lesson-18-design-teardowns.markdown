For [this lesson](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/dashboard#/web-design-basics/your-own-design-teardowns), we must answer a series of design-oriented questions for several sites, including [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), [TMZ](http://www.tmz.com/) [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/), and [Medium](https://medium.com/top-100/june-2014). In addition, we had to sketch the visual hierarchy of these sites, which I did roughly below:

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

<img height="70%" width="70%" style="text-align:center" src="/assets/design_teardowns.jpg">

</div>

## New York Times

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

<img height="60%" width="60%" style="text-align:center" src="/assets/design_teardowns_1.jpg">

</div>

### Who is the user?

A casual reader, looking for today's news.

### What is the user's critical goal? (or at least what do you think the site owner wants them to do?)

Get informed about the most important recent news stories.

### Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes, pretty well. After looking at the logo, the reader's eye is quickly drawn to the large picture to the left-of-center, which leads to a prominent story. But the real main story is in the left-most column, also easy to find, with a large title.

I actually think this may be savy on NYT's part; they show you an important story first, but not the main one, even as you find the main story immediately afterward; this way, you may be interested in the secondary story as well.

### What font families are most prominent on the site?

Most prominent are nyt-cheltenham and Georgia.

### How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

The custom nyt font looks official and adds a personal touch, while clearly designating headlines from article text. The flow is improved because the user knows how to get to the new stories he or she is after, immediately.

Design-wise, the use of one font in bold for headlines and one font normal for text makes it easy on the eyes, but perhaps too easy; to make the page look a bit more dynamic, the designers of The New York Times include the left headlines in bolder, italic nyt-cheltenham, so the eye is drawn left column, down, then to the center.

### How do the line spacings, sizes, colors and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

The combination is pleasing to the eye... there is a clear color pattern favoring black (dark grey) and white, with a few dashes of color, and a few, non-overwhelming images.

The use of white space is also exemplary: there is nothing cluttering up the areas at the top of the page, next to the NYT logo, to make it top-heavy; instead, it is blank, adding to the pleasing, minimalist sense of hierarchy that suggests: (1) newspaper, (2) news categories, (3) news articles. The margins are also generous.

### What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

There is a larger block on the bottom right, if you scroll just a bit, that renders something (an ad?) but it doesn't appear on my screen. And then there is a lot of white space below that for no reason I can identify, once you scroll down.

Also, the NYT has several special segments like "Listen to the daily", "smarter living", and "the daily 360" that seem equally important and could be grouped together, perhaps in a box for special offerings, instead of being squeezed between article headlines.

## TMZ

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

<img height="70%" width="70%" style="text-align:center" src="/assets/design_teardowns_2.jpg">

</div>

### Who is the user?

A slightly more avid fan of celebrity news and entertainment, looking for the latest stories.

### What is the user's critical goal? (or at least what do you think the site owner wants them to do?)

Get informed on the latest celebrity news/entertainment, including what the biggest stories are.

### Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Very well. The biggest story is easily visible, in large bold font, just below a series of smaller images and headlines that have many of the other prominent stories. A reader can see at a glance what (1) the biggest splash is, and (2) what other interesting stories are popular.

### What font families are most prominent on the site?

ProximaNovaExCn_Black and Sans Pro.

### How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

Like for the NYT, this site features only two major fonts; two is a good number to keep things visually simple, but not completely predictable. The ProximaNovaExCn font is a close-together font for letters, so it makes the "categories" of TMZ's content easily distinguishable from the headlines that appear elsewhere on the page.

### How do the line spacings, sizes, colors and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

There is a fair amount of color on the page, but it doesn't detract from the dominance of black, white, and red, which makes for a fun and sexy vibe. The boldness of the website title contributes to the brand awareness; the user is always conscious of where he or she is.

The perfect visual hierarchy from website title to categories of available content and then prominent stories is steady for each page, and makes flow very easy. Typical patterns for article flow are also implemented, e.g. for each article the margins and bottom are full of suggested additional articles, to keep the user reading.

Two other things of note: the top right has a prominent search icon, for users who want to find content, and the top left has a prominent red button with "Got a tip?" written on it---this lets users know TMZ accepts tips, for future reference. All of this is useful for flow.

### What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

TMZ's site is very well designed, like the NYT's, but there is a banner just above the TMZ logo that is distracting, and looks like an ad, even though it always features some new TMZ content; this should be made to look less like an ad, so the user doesn't automatically scan over it.

## Huffington Post

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

<img height="70%" width="70%" style="text-align:center" src="/assets/design_teardowns_3.jpg">

</div>

#### Who is the user?

An average consumer of entertainment and news.

### What is the user's critical goal? (or at least what do you think the site owner wants them to do?)

To get to an interesting story.

### Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Yes. The stories are in a simple hierarchy, with the biggest at the top, but the others not difficult to find if you scroll down.

### What font families are most prominent on the site?

ProximaNovaCond is the only prominent font used.

### How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

This font has nice spacing, and its use everywhere gives the site a professional feel. As far as I can see, the font doesn't really connect to the flow here, except that large and bold fonts are used to designate headlines from text. Overall, the font usage doesn't get in the way of the user experience---a low bar, but an important one.

### How do the line spacings, sizes, colors and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

There's a lot of images on this site, which give it a busier feeling, but also a more entertaining one. The site flow is pretty simple; the user can go directly to the big story and the many other interesting stories, which have a simple hierarchy: (1) big story, (2) other stories. Huffpost's navigation bar at the top left has a button that lets you go to different news categories too.

### What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

The large white lettering of the main story title, over a picture, is very busy; it makes reading the main story a bit harder, and doesn't look great. But the biggest problem with the Huffpost's website is the tiny, nearly inconspicuous button on the top left that lets you find other categories of news; there should be at least a word next to it like, "offerings", so you know where to go.

The fact that Huffpost's categories are obscured so much makes it easy to forget about all that content when looking at their main website; you could be forgiven for thinking Huffpo was just a bunch of trending articles, like a large blog with many contributors, instead of a news outlet with lots of differentiated content.

## Medium

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

<img height="70%" width="70%" style="text-align:center" src="/assets/design_teardowns_4.jpg">

</div>

### Who is the user?

Someone looking for interesting stories, but most probably specific stories, by category or author.

### What is the user's critical goal? (or at least what do you think the site owner wants them to do?

To read absorbing articles about the user's interests, or learn something cool about a new topic.

### Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

Not quite. The site is undeniably aesthetic, but the search button is tiny, and the biggest items of attraction leads you to learn more about the site's mechanics, which I imagine is not what most users want first.

Their top navigation bar is also tiny, and has a lot of random things on it; only when you scroll down do you really start to see that the site content is organized in several big categories, unless you first squint and read past "Home" (why is there a home button on the navbsar?), "Popular on Medium", "Audio" (?), "Members only" (mysterious...), and "Handpicked by medium staff" (long).

### What font families are most prominent on the site?

Serif and Sans-serif.

### How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

Both of these fonts have very nice spacing and make the site easy on the eyes.

### How do the line spacings, sizes, colors and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

The coloration of this site is beautiful, and mixes well with the generously used white space to produce an artsy, minimalist style that matches Medium's goals exactly.  The large, dark grey title on the left immediately grabs your attention and directs you understanding how Medium works, even if I personally think their goal should first be to surf a few articles.

### What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?

Quite a few things. First, make the navbar larger and reduce it to "Technology", "Creativity", "Entrepreneurship", "Culture", "Self", and "Politics", which is already more than enough for a navbar. Put the other stuff about membership and editor's picks just below the big banner. Also, have a less ambiguous lead to learning how the site works (if that is such a big goal), like "How Medium Works" instead of the current big title, and then small subtitle that still doesn't make clear what the site does.

I'd also put the audio content below "Today's top content" stories, so you have to scroll, because it should just be an option rather than a main attraction (it feels weird to say your site has "audio", write up in the navbar---who cares, it's user-contributed content, it could be in any format).
