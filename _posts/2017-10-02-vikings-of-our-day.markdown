In HBO's Silicon Valley, the main character, Richard Hendricks, says that software engineers--and in particular nerds--"finally have the chance" to be at the top of the social ladder, to be as he says, "the vikings of our day".

From this declaration of selfless purpose, the Viking Code School was born, a challenging and highly selective online academy designed to teach a new generation of digital pillagers the arts of internet navigation and combat.

I am one of them. And this is my story.

Or, well, okay, I made most of that up---almost all of it, actually. But the quote... the quote is real. And this is the blog of a true Viking (code school student), where you will find recounted the many travails, blood-stained battles, exotic romances, and tales of wonder, that make a modern software engineer.
